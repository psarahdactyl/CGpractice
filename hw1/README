Assignment 1

I developed and tested this in Ubuntu 14.04.

I did not include the compiled file, just the source.
Running "make red_triangle" will build the program.
Then "./red_triangle" runs it, as you already know.

The file is still called red_triangle.cpp for Makefile purposes, although it shows the other two shapes as well.
