HW 4

i. Features
	All the ones required in the assignment PDF: 
		-reading in an SMF file and creating polygons
		-transformations to canonical view volume
		-clipping 3D lines with modified Cohen-Sutherland
		-perspective and parallel projection from 3D to 2D
		-viewport mapping
		-drawing lines
		-exporting an XPM file

ii. Issues
	I had issues with rotation most likely with the VPN (parameters u,v,q,r,w).
	In particular, test runs 6, 13, 15, and 16 turn out a little off in terms of rotation. 

iii. Language and OS
	C++
	Ubuntu 14.04

iv. Compiler
	g++-4.8, 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04, GNU C++ compiler
	The makefile uses the flag for C++11.

v. Name of file with main()
	CG_hw4.cpp
	
vi. How to Compile and Run
	type "make run":
		which builds the executable and runs every sample run in the homework PDF.

	or type "make" to build then run:
	"./CG_hw4 <insert commandline arguments>"

	"make clean" deletes all .xpm files and the executable.
