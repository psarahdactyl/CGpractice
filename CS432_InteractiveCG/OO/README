Assignment 2

I developed and tested this in Ubuntu 14.04.

I did not include the compiled file, just the source.
Running "make other_shapes" will build the program.
Then "./other_shapes" runs it, as you already know.

The file is still called red_triangle.cpp for Makefile purposes, although it shows the other two shapes as well.
