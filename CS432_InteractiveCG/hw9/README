Assignment 9

PLATFORM:
I developed and tested this in Ubuntu 14.04.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Type "make run1" to run the Bezier patch assignment (hw7) with the new texture.
Type "make run2" to run the rotating shaded model (hw6) with the procedurally generated texture.

Instructions for keys and menus to access other functionality is output to the console upon running the programs.

NOTE:
The 3D texture could use some optimization (but of course I don't have time) so, that one takes a little longer to start up. But it's there! Just wait a second.
