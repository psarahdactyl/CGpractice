Assignment 6

PLATFORM:
I developed and tested this in Ubuntu 14.04.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Running "make hw6" will build the program.
Typing "make run" will build the program if it doesn't already exist and run the program with the bound-bunny_5k.smf file as an argument.
	OR
Typing "./hw6 <SMF FILE NAME>" will run the program on another argument.
