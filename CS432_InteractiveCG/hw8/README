Assignment 8

PLATFORM:
I developed and tested this in Ubuntu 14.04.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Running "make hw8" will build the program. Then you can run it with "./hw8".

Alternatively, typing "make run" will build the program if it doesn't already exist and run the program.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR KEYS:
'q' -  quits the program

'=' -  rotates camera counter-clockwise
'-' -  rotates camera clockwise
'r' -  increases orbit radius
'R' -  decreases orbit radius
'h' -  increases height of camera on cylinder
'H' -  decreases height of camera on cylinder
'a' -  toggles anti-aliasing

'z' -  resets all transformations

Clicking on an object once will make it brighter, then clicking it a second time will put it back to its original color.
