\section{Idea and Why}

For the final project in this class, I want to write a shader particle system that simulates fire. Nothing too fancy, but I want to explore simulation in general and fire is pretty and interesting.

\section{Interaction}

The user will be able to turn the fire ``on'' and ``off'' using a drop down menu, and also control the parameters of the fire. Using certain keys, the user will be able to increase and decrease the speed and size of the fire. I am also playing around with the idea of changing the ``temperature'' of the fire by making it go from a yellow/orange fire to a blue-ish one.

Similar to Assignment 5, I want the user to be able to pick an SMF model to be read into the application through the command line. This time, I will also scale larger models down so that they fit into the default view port or I will just make the view port bigger, if possible. 

If a user picks a model to be loaded into the scene, the fire will interact with it, going around it like a real fire would (assuming all the models are not flammable).
