Assignment 3

PLATFORM:
I developed and tested this in Ubuntu 14.04.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Running "make hw3" will build the first program.
Then "./hw3" runs it.

NOTES:
The drop down menu containing the Stop and Start Animation is only accesible from the main window.
Pressing single letter keys to change colors only works if the second window is "in focus."
