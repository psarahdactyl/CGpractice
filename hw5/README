Assignment 5

PLATFORM:
I developed and tested this in Ubuntu 14.04.

Running "make hw5" will build the first program.
Then "./hw5 <SMF FILE NAME>" runs it.

NOTES:

INSTRUCTIONS FOR KEYS

'+' -  increases speed of rotation
'-' -  decreases speed of rotation
'r' -  increases orbit radius
'R' -  decreases orbit radius
'h' -  increases height of camera on cylinder

'z' -  resets all transformations

There is also a drop down menu to start and stop the rotation
