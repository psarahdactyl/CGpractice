Assignment 5

PLATFORM:
I developed and tested this in Ubuntu 14.04.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Running "make hw5" will build the program.
Typing "make run" will build the program if it doesn't already exist and run the program with the bound-bunny_5k.smf file as an argument.
	OR
Typing "./hw5 <SMF FILE NAME>" will run the program on another argument.

NOTES:

INSTRUCTIONS FOR KEYS
'q' -  quits the program

'+' -  increases speed of rotation
'-' -  decreases speed of rotation
'r' -  increases orbit radius
'R' -  decreases orbit radius
'h' -  increases height of camera on cylinder
'H' -  decreases height of camera on cylinder
'z' -  resets all transformations

There is also a drop down menu to start and stop the rotation
and to switch between parallel and perspective projections.


I didn't know if we were supposed to/required to change the bounding box to account for models that don't fit within bounding box.
I don't know how to do that, so this program only looks good when smaller files are used. I suggest the bunny! I included it in the zip file.
